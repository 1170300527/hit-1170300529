## Introduction
this project is based on the HIT software construction course Lab
Orbit system simulator is a open source project aimed for simulating any orbit system including stellar system, atom structure, social network circle and so on.

## Objective
My final goal is to build a simulator that can help people understand real orbit system and help teacher and researcher to represnt the orbit system easily and clearly.

## file structure
the source file is in the 'src' folder and all test input files are in the 'input' folder, any log file can be seen at the 'log' folder and if you use the dump operation, you can see the output file at the 'output' folder
