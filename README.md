# Orbit System Stimulator

> Be easy and free to stimulate any orbit-like system using Orbit System Stimulator

## Introduction

  This project is based on the HIT software construction course Lab3

  Orbit system simulator is a open source project aimed for simulating any orbit system including stellar system, atom structure, social network circle and so on.The project hasn't completed yet and still on its beta version.

  Until now, the program can stimulate the stellar system, atom structure, social network circle, if you have some new idea, be free to add to it.

## Objective

  My final goal is to build a simulator that can help people understand real orbit system and help teachers and researchers to represent the orbit system easily and clearly.

## Quick start

  The UI has not been completed yet and if you want to start the program, you need to use a java JDK to build it.And the menu is on the console, once you had built it, click run and the all the available operation on the console.Chose the operation that you want to change the orbit system.

  If you want to read the orbit system, use the readFromFile operation, the file waiting to be read will be in the 'input' folder, you can choose the file by changing the code in the application.java or you can just write a new txt input file.

  The program has offered a simple visualization tool which you can choose it in the menu, use the visualization to help you see the structure of the orbit system. 

## File structure

  The source file is in the 'src' folder and all test input files are in the 'input' folder, any log file can be seen at the 'log' folder and if you use the dump operation, you can see the output file at the 'output' folder
