# Orbit System Stimulator

## Introduction
  this project is based on the HIT software construction course Lab3
  Orbit system simulator is a open source project aimed for simulating any orbit system including stellar system, atom structure, social network circle and so on.The project hasn't completed yet and still on its beta version.
  Until now, the program can stimulate the stellar system, atom structure, social network circle, if you have some new idea, be free to add to it.


## Objective
  My final goal is to build a simulator that can help people understand real orbit system and help teacher and researcher to represnt the orbit system easily and clearly.


## Quick start
  the UI has not been completed yet and if you want to start the program, you need to use a java JDK to build it.And the menu is on the console, if you want to read the orbit system, use the readFromFile operation.


## File structure
  the source file is in the 'src' folder and all test input files are in the 'input' folder, any log file can be seen at the 'log' folder and if you use the dump operation, you can see the output file at the 'output' folder
