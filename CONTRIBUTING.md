In order to help you understand the project, where I am heading and how you can contribute, below are several resources and answers.



## Why contribute?

orbit-System simulator is an open source project aiming at building a simulator for simulating read orbit system

Whether you are an organization or an individual working or studying in the field of orbit system or simply as an individual looking for fun, contributing to the orbit-System simulator project may represent a great choice for you.

## Where is the project heading ?

the project is based on the HIT's software contruction Lab and now it is heading for these goals:

- Of course, fix bugs and develop features which are identify as non-critical but would really helpful ;
- the UI of the simulator still need to be completed as it's lack of a great representation of the real orbit system
- for the long term, I hope this project can become a useful simulator that help children understand real orbit system

## Code of Conduct 

orbit-System simulator has adopted a Code of Conduct that I expect project participants to adhere to.
